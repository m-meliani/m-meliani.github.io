## About me 
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Evolution Differential Equation of the Institute of Mathematics of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague. My Postdoc advisor is [Prof. Eduard Feireisl](https://www.math.cas.cz/index.php/members/researcher/37). I obtained my PhD working in the field of evolution equations for acoustics under the supervision of [Dr. Vanja Nikolić](https://vanjanikolic.net). 

### Research interests
* Analysis and simulation of nonlinear/nonlocal-in-time wave and fluid equations.
* Aymptotic and long-term behavior of nonlinear PDEs.
* PDE-constrained shape optimization
