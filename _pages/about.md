## About me 
I am currently a Research Associate at the department of Mathematical Sciences of the University of Bath working on ERC project PSINumScat with [Prof. Euan Spence](https://people.bath.ac.uk/eas25/). I was previously a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Mathematics of the Czech Academy of Sciences with [Prof. Eduard Feireisl](https://www.math.cas.cz/index.php/members/researcher/37). I obtained my PhD working in the field of nonlinear evolution equations for acoustics under the supervision of [Dr. Vanja NikoliÄ‡](https://vanjanikolic.net). 

### Research interests
* Analysis and simulation of nonlinear/nonlocal-in-time wave and fluid equations.
* Aymptotic and long-term behavior of nonlinear PDEs.
* PDE-constrained shape optimization
